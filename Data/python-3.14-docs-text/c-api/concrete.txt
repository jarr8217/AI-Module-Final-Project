Concrete Objects Layer
**********************

The functions in this chapter are specific to certain Python object
types. Passing them an object of the wrong type is not a good idea; if
you receive an object from a Python program and you are not sure that
it has the right type, you must perform a type check first; for
example, to check that an object is a dictionary, use
"PyDict_Check()".  The chapter is structured like the "family tree" of
Python object types.

Warning:

  While the functions described in this chapter carefully check the
  type of the objects which are passed in, many of them do not check
  for "NULL" being passed instead of a valid object.  Allowing "NULL"
  to be passed in can cause memory access violations and immediate
  termination of the interpreter.
