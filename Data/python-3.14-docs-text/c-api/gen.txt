Generator Objects
*****************

Generator objects are what Python uses to implement generator
iterators. They are normally created by iterating over a function that
yields values, rather than explicitly calling "PyGen_New()" or
"PyGen_NewWithQualName()".

type PyGenObject

   The C structure used for generator objects.

PyTypeObject PyGen_Type

   The type object corresponding to generator objects.

int PyGen_Check(PyObject *ob)

   Return true if *ob* is a generator object; *ob* must not be "NULL".
   This function always succeeds.

int PyGen_CheckExact(PyObject *ob)

   Return true if *ob*'s type is "PyGen_Type"; *ob* must not be
   "NULL".  This function always succeeds.

PyObject *PyGen_New(PyFrameObject *frame)
    *Return value: New reference.*

   Create and return a new generator object based on the *frame*
   object. A reference to *frame* is stolen by this function. The
   argument must not be "NULL".

PyObject *PyGen_NewWithQualName(PyFrameObject *frame, PyObject *name, PyObject *qualname)
    *Return value: New reference.*

   Create and return a new generator object based on the *frame*
   object, with "__name__" and "__qualname__" set to *name* and
   *qualname*. A reference to *frame* is stolen by this function.  The
   *frame* argument must not be "NULL".

PyCodeObject *PyGen_GetCode(PyGenObject *gen)

   Return a new *strong reference* to the code object wrapped by
   *gen*. This function always succeeds.


Asynchronous Generator Objects
==============================

See also: **PEP 525**

PyTypeObject PyAsyncGen_Type

   The type object corresponding to asynchronous generator objects.
   This is available as "types.AsyncGeneratorType" in the Python
   layer.

   Added in version 3.6.

PyObject *PyAsyncGen_New(PyFrameObject *frame, PyObject *name, PyObject *qualname)

   Create a new asynchronous generator wrapping *frame*, with
   "__name__" and "__qualname__" set to *name* and *qualname*. *frame*
   is stolen by this function and must not be "NULL".

   On success, this function returns a *strong reference* to the new
   asynchronous generator. On failure, this function returns "NULL"
   with an exception set.

   Added in version 3.6.

int PyAsyncGen_CheckExact(PyObject *op)

   Return true if *op* is an asynchronous generator object, false
   otherwise. This function always succeeds.

   Added in version 3.6.


Deprecated API
==============

PyAsyncGenASend_CheckExact(op)

   This is a *soft deprecated* API that was included in Python's C API
   by mistake.

   It is solely here for completeness; do not use this API.
